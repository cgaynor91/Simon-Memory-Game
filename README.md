For my second milestone project I decided to create the [Simon Memory Game](https://github.com/cgaynor91/Simon-Memory-Game/). This game dates back to 1978 when it was first manufactured by Milton Bradley in 1978. The game is a test of memory. The programme creates a series of sounds and lights and requires the player to then repeat the sequence. Provided the player succeeds the sequence continues, incrementing by one each time. 

The original game had 4 settings of difficulty levels, I have adapted this idea by implementing a "strict mode". In this mode the player must get each sequence correctly, failure to do so would revert the player back to the beginning. In order for the player to win the game they must repeat the sequenec correctly 20 times.

## UX

The aim of the Simon game is to have fun, while testing your memory. The game itself is not too complex in ideals so this lends itself suitable to all age groups. The option of having strict mode means, if younger children are playing strict mode could be disabled in order for them to not be discouraged if they get one wrong and are reverted to the start. Likewise, adults may find this not challenging enough therefore strict mode allows for a greater challenge of memory.
